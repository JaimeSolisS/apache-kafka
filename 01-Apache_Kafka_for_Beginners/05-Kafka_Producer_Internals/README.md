# Programing Language Options

Kafka producer API is primarily made available in Java. In this course, we will be using Java APIs.

However the API is are also available in other languages and all those language bindings follow the same structure as Java APIs.

Some of the most commonly used language libraries are listed here:

- [Kafka Client for Java](https://docs.confluent.io/clients-kafka-java/current/overview.html)
- [Kafka Client for Python](https://docs.confluent.io/clients-confluent-kafka-python/current/overview.html)
- [Kafka Client for Go](https://docs.confluent.io/clients-confluent-kafka-go/current/overview.html)
- [Kafka Client for C++](https://docs.confluent.io/clients-librdkafka/current/overview.html)
- [Kafka Client for .NET](https://docs.confluent.io/clients-confluent-kafka-dotnet/current/overview.html)

There are many other language bindings that are implemented by open source community.
